# Simon-Game

This is a PC version of the 1976 widely successful memory game Simon. It features all of the original's game characteristics like:
 1. Increased difficulty over time
 2. Availability of strict mode. When this is enabled, whenever the user chooses the wrong tile, the game starts all over from score 0
 
It also is the main project(and the last one based on their curriculum) of Free Code Camp front end development certification.
